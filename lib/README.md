Shared modules that might be used in multiple facets of my application. Things in this folder should not be tightly coupled to your application, and should theoretically be able to be plucked from one project to another, and work as expected (assuming all dependencies are available).

Ideally if modules could get grouped by type, i.e math/percentages.ts, api/fetcher
